# HED Using OpenCV and DNN
HED algorithm is used with the pretrained caffe model (trained using BSDS Dataset) and inbuilt OpenCV DNN Module.In this project, we apply Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED) with OpenCV and Deep Learning on images and videos. Based on the reference project, I modified it to measure the comparison of Canny Edge Detection Output and HED Output using CPU processing time. 

### Note:
In our case, the processing time is for CPU and not for GPU.
